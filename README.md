## Shedding Blacklight on Online Privacy

We exploit passively collected browsing data from comScore along with https://themarkup.org/blacklight to estimate whether the websites visited by poorer people and less educated people tend to visit websites with lower privacy standards than the better-off and better-educated people. 

We also use data from https://whotracks.me/ to augment our analyses.
